# Tracer
Simple chrome tracer.  
Just include `tracer.hpp` and start using it.

This project is **heavily** inspired by [https://github.com/hrydgard/minitrace](https://github.com/hrydgard/minitrace) and it was developed mostly for educational purposes.

For production-level tracing, please refer to the [perfetto SDK](https://perfetto.dev/docs/instrumentation/tracing-sdk), which provides a more complete and correct implementation of the chrome tracing specification.
